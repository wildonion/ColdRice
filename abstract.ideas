        TODO: virtual brain must check the ownership of neuron device using its UUID or a unique behaviour address
        TODO: the virtual brain collect data into different categories like emotion works; logical works; anger works and so on using ANN or AI
        TODO: then virtual brain stores all categories which every category has its own works in our blockchain and all works have a public address in order to interact with each others and 		other categories using smart contracts with truffle and COP concept

              check the ownership of virtual brain so every real brain must hav UUID(or a unique address of our neuron device stuck(later on we can use brain waves to detect the thoughts of real brain and send those waves to our virtual brain without using a neuron device) on users brain)
              either is a new or old data if is new it will added to the blockchain with its category and real brain info like its address and its waves; if is old the virtual brain must detect the rest of work or what was the final result of that using ANN or AI
        PURPOSE: we want to build another human not a robot ofcourse but a virtual brain which it will do all human works and make all human decisions according to the order of human real
        	     brain; the human brain must active the virtual mode with a kind of signal or some orders or some thoughts(brain waves thoughts)
        PURPOSE: this technology is usefull for interacting with other blockchain and distributed systems to have copy of a human brain and make presence of human less in computer world
        		 we can use it in mental payment system, book writing & create movie or make a new language from user's mind using ANN or AI concept to show the right concept of what he/she is thinking or imagining to the other people or other blockchain system finally write your about-me book!
